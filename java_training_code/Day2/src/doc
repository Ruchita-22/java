By default all the data member and member function of the parent class are access to child class if they are not private

if we make base class private
Illegal modifier for the class Base; only public, abstract & final are permitted 

if base class is final
The type Child cannot subclass the final class Base

Inhertance for data member
-------------------------------------------

Whenever the parent class and the child class both r having the same data member then this concept is known as data hiding
and priority goes to child class
to access the parent class variable and method we use super

Inheritance in member function
----------------------------------------------------
Whenever the parent class and the child class both r having the same member function (dikto same) then 
this concept is known as method overriding
