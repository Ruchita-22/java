    Filter

    A filter is an object that dynamically intercepts requests and responses to transform or use the information contained in the requests or responses.

    Filters typically do not themselves create responses but instead provide universal functions that can be "attached" to any type of servlet or JSP page.

    The filter is run before rendering view but after controller rendered response.

    A Filter is used in the web layer only as it is defined in web.xml.

    Filters are more suitable when treating your request/response as a black box system. They'll work regardless of how the servlet is implemented.

    Filters are used to perform filtering tasks such as-----
    
login authentication ,
auditing of incoming requests from web pages, 
conversion, 
logging, 
compression, 
encryption and decryption, 
input validation etc.

    A Servlet Filter is used in the web layer only, you can't use it outside of a web context.
