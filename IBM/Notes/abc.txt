Trick question! Private methods can NOT be overriden, but they CAN be
re-declared/redefined in the subclass, and called directly on the
subclass
object. But polymorphism will not apply.
================================

Protected members (methods and data) can be inherited by subclasses,
including those outside the package. The only difference between default
(no modifier) and protected, is that protected extends visibility outside
the package... but ONLY to subclasses.
================================

The result of an arithmetic operation on any two primitive integer
operands
will be at least an int -- even if the operands are byte and short.
================================


You can declare or initialize more than one variable in a for loop, but
you
can't mix declarations with initializations.
================================

Floating point numbers don't produce a divide-by-zero
ArithmeticException.
They will give a result which is a Not a Number value.
================================

Shifting bits by a number greater than or equal to the number of bits
in the result (eg. 32 bits for an int) will cause the value to be shifted
by the number modulo the number of bits in the value (you shift by 33%32
which is 1).
